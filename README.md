# GDP-and-Economic-Comparison-Sri-Lanka-vs.-USA

## Data Preparation
Dataset imported from kaggle 
To do analysis we require both data related to Sri Lanka and USA. But its difficult to find all data from same data set. So data imported from two datasets seperately. 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amritharj/economy-of-sri-lanka
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/malayvyas/usa-gdp-dataset-19612021

## Data Process 
- Using python we have identified null values and removed from both datasets. 
- There is no any duplication therefore no need to remove duplications 
- Except year all data types are inappropriate so they have cleaned with removing unwanted strings 
- Converted to appropriate data types 
- Given suitable names which haven't proper names before
